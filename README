The purpose of this project is to implement dijkstra algorithm in C++. You can give your own map.
Map are represented with single characters such as :
  + F (floor)    : cost 5
  + M (Mud)      : cost 8
  + C (Concrete) : cost 2
  + W (Wall)     : can't be crossed
  + S (Start)    : cost 0
  + E (End)      : cost 1


Maps can be any shape while it is surounded by walls.

to compile type : make.

Fiew tests are provided in tests/ directory
